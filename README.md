# Smithsonian Dataset Cards

This repository contains Dataset Cards for some Smithsonian datasets. To write these, we used the Dataset Card template from [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md) as a starting point and only included fields with applicable information.

Some items detailed on each Dataset Card include the original intent for gathering the dataset, its context, assumptions, changes to the data, normalizations, transformations that have occurred, and explanation of known biases and social impact.

We chose an initial handful of Smithsonian datasets on which pilot Dataset Cards. The datasets we chose for this initial release of dataset cards are not meant to be representative of all Smithsonian data or content types, but they do span natural science, history, and culture.
