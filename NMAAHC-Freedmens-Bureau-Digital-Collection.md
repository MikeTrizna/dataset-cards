### Curation Rationale  

The dataset represents the portion of the Freedmen’s Bureau Archive that has been transcribed as of February, 2022.  


### Source Data  

The text in the Freedmen’s Bureau documents transcribed by virtual volunteers.  

  
#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization  

Each document was transcribed and reviewed by a virtual volunteer using these instructions: https://transcription.si.edu/instructions-freedmens-bureau.  Transcriptions include special formatting characters including, e.g. “\n” for new line, and “|” for column formatting. 


#### Who are the source language producers?  

The data were created by over 35,000 humans from all over the world who volunteered with SI’s Transcription Center as of February 2022.  

There are hundreds of thousands of people represented in the data. These people include formerly enslaved and free African Americans and southern whites served by the Freedmen’s Bureau as well as bureau employees and other individuals who came in contact with the bureau. 


### Personal and Sensitive Information  

The dataset contains people’s names, both of those served by the Bureau, as well as employees. It also contains addresses. There are many identity categories mentioned in the data, but none come directly from the person to whom they refer.  
  

### Social Impact of Dataset  

As the Civil War drew to a close, President Lincoln and members of Congress debated how to reunite the nation, reconstruct Southern society, and help formerly enslaved individuals make the transition to freedom and citizenship. As one response, in March 1865 Congress created the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, commonly referred to as Tthe Freemen's Bureau. Administered by the War Department, the Bureau followed the department’s war-inspired record-keeping system. These handwritten records include letters, labor contracts, lists of food rations issued, indentures of apprenticeship, marriage and hospital registers, and census lists. They provide a unique view into the lives of newly freed individuals and the social conditions of the South after the war. 

The Bureau was responsible for providing assistance to four million formerly enslaved individuals and hundreds of thousands of impoverished Southern whites. The Bureau provided food, clothing, medical care, and legal representation; promoted education; helped legalize marriages; and assisted African American soldiers and sailors in securing back pay, enlistment bounties, and pensions. In addition, the Bureau promoted a system of labor contracts to replace the slavery system and tried to settle freedmen and women on abandoned or confiscated land. The Bureau was also responsible for protecting freedmen and women from intimidation and assaults by Southern whites. The Bureau set up offices throughout the 15 Southern and border states and the District of Columbia. Under-funded by Congress and opposed by President Andrew Johnson, the Bureau only operated between 1865 and 1872. 

Transcribing the Freedmen’s Bureau gives unprecedented access to this invaluable set of records and allows family historians and genealogists to search for their ancestors and for scholars and students to research various topics in the Freedmen’s Bureau in ways previously not possible. 

Content includes outdated and often culturally insensitive, offensive, or racist views. Content also reflects direct and sometimes graphic accounts of impoverishment, mistreatment, and injustice, which may be particularly harmful to readers. We have chosen to leave the content as it was created for the benefit of research from the primary source.  

### Discussion of Biases  

This dataset is not the entire Freedmen’s Bureau Archive, only the portion that was transcribed by February, 2022. Future dataset releases will be more complete as transcription proceeds.
